## Description and Datasets
We decided to rank our neighborhoods based on three metrics, livability, crime, and fun. We also weighted these categories differently, attributing greater weight to things such as crime than fun because it's quite difficult to have fun in a neighborhood that isn't safe. To be more specific, our data included the amount of playgrounds in each neighborhood, the air quality of each neighborhood and monthly criminal activity.
